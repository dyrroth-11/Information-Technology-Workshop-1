# Linux-helpDesk-Project

**Project Description**


We build a menu system for new linux user, which allow the user to use wild cards. For all cases we make sure the user does not attempt something that will not work by implementing  error checking methods. The error checking ensures that the user entering the file name must be a valid file name. We also make sure that any time the output from any command exceeds one screen of information we break it up so that none of it scrolls off the screen before the user can read it.

We put the help display the main menu and the three sub-menus into a total of five script files. Also the submenu becomes a new process and we must ensure that the new process knows if it is in expert or novice model. We allowed the user to enter in one or more filenames also allow them to use wild cards.


**It have following menus.**

-  The UNIX help main menu.
-  The File Management Commands Sub-menu.
-  The Text Processing Commands Sub-menu.
-  The System Status Commands Sub-menu.
