echo -e "\n It is really exciting to shift to linux after windows, it has a lot of features different and can actually give the user immense power as the person can do a lot and almost everything using the terminal in linux. And it is really fun too. This is our first project on linux and it was really exciting to create something using the terminal. It is really easy to use our main menu project. It is as easy as using a graphical user interface. The user will have no trouble using it and does not need any knowledge of linux before. So the project has been truly made for its purpose.And we would like to acknowledge our tutors and teachers of ITW because of whom we have reached at a state that we could make a project of this standards. And at last we(Ashish Patel and Utkarsh Mallick) would like to thank each other for our own cooperation in making of this project.\n"
